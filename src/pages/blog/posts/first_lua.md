# üêâ What is Lua and Why You Should Try It

Lua is a lightweight, fast, and flexible scripting language that appeared in 1993. It's written in C and is most often used not as a standalone language, but as an **embeddable tool** for other applications.

If you've played *World of Warcraft* and installed addons, you've already encountered Lua. Redis executes Lua scripts internally. Nginx uses it to handle HTTP requests. In NeoVim, plugins can also be written in Lua. In short ‚Äî the language isn't among the most popular, but it's extremely useful and embeddable in many infrastructural solutions.

## üöÄ Lua Syntax: Simple and Clear

Let's start with the classic:

```lua
print("Hello, World!")
```

Lua's syntax slightly resembles Pascal and Python: constructs end with `end`, types are inferred automatically, everything is simple and compact ‚Äî ideal for scripts and prototypes.

The language has local and global variables:

- Local variables are declared using `local` and only exist within the current block.
- Global variables are the default. They are stored in a special table `_G`, accessible from any piece of code running in the same execution environment.

A slightly more practical example ‚Äî a problem from [Advent of Code 2022, Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1):
Find the maximum sum of numbers grouped into blocks separated by empty lines.
```lua
local max, current = 0, 0
for line in io.lines("input.txt") do
    if line == "" then
        if current > max then
            max = current
        end
        current = 0
    else
        current = current + tonumber(line)
    end
end

if current > max then
    max = current
end

print(max)
```

## üß© Data Types in Lua

Lua has only eight basic types:

```
number, string, boolean, nil, function, table, thread, userdata
```

### Some Nuances:

- `number` combines both integers and floating-point numbers.
- `string` ‚Äî regular strings, are immutable.
- `nil` ‚Äî Null, Nil, None, call it what you want.
- `function` ‚Äî functions are first-class values. Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
- `table` ‚Äî a universal data structure: array (indexed from 1), dictionary, and object ‚Äî all in one.
- `thread` ‚Äî coroutines.
- `userdata` ‚Äî interface for interacting with C data.

Typing is dynamic and weak: variables can change type on the fly, and Lua often tries to "guess" your intention. For example, the string "42" can be implicitly converted to a number.

## üîå Embeddability: Lua's Main Strength

Lua can be conveniently embedded into any C or even Go program. The interpreter provides a [simple C API](https://www.lua.org/pil/24.html) through which you can execute scripts, exchange data, and extend the language with new functions.

### Example: How to Execute a Lua Script from Go

Lua file `fib5.lua`:

```lua
function fib(n)
    local fib = {1, 1}
    for i = 3,n,1 do
        fib[#fib+1] = fib[#fib] + fib[#fib-1]
    end
    return fib[n]
end
return fib(5)
```

Go program:

I will use the package [github.com/yuin/gopher-lua](https://github.com/yuin/gopher-lua) which provides a simple interaction interface, but if desired, you can do without extra dependencies using CGO.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	lua "github.com/yuin/gopher-lua"
)

func main() {
	var l *lua.LState = lua.NewState()
	defer l.Close()
	if err := l.DoFile("fib5.lua"); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// get the execution result from the top of the stack
	result := l.Get(-1)
	// and clear it
	l.Pop(1)
	fmt.Printf("result: %d\n", result) // result: 5
}
```

If we want to perform the calculation again, we don't need to reload the file; the function fib(n) is already in the global variables of our l *lua.LState. We just need to retrieve it, put it on the stack along with the arguments, and then call l.Call(nargs, nret).

```go
...
// push the function from global variables onto the stack
l.Push(l.GetGlobal("fib")) // stack: function "fib"
// push the function argument onto the stack
l.Push(lua.LNumber(15))    // stack: function "fib", 15
// l.Call takes the function and 1 argument from the stack, and pushes 1 result back
l.Call(1, 1)               // stack: 610
result = l.Get(-1)         // stack: 610
l.Pop(1)                   // stack:
fmt.Printf("result: %d\n", result) //result: 610
```

## üåê Where Lua is Already Used

Lua is actively used in real projects:

- **World of Warcraft** ‚Äî addons and interface.
- **Redis** ‚Äî atomic operations in scripts.
- **Nginx** ‚Äî `ngx_http_lua_module` module.
- **NeoVim** ‚Äî modern API for plugins.
- **Game engines** ‚Äî Defold, Pico-8, Love2D, and others.

## üß™ Why Learn Lua in 2025?

Lua is not a universal language for all occasions. But if you:

- write backend code using Nginx or Redis,
- work with NeoVim and want to create plugins,
- or simply want to embed a scripting language into your application,

...then Lua is the perfect tool. It's small, fast, and flexible. Plus ‚Äî it pleasantly surprises with its conciseness.
